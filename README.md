# 🧠 NeuroSource  
### *A living, open catalogue of neural foundation models.*

> **NeuroSource** is a community-curated repository of **baseline and foundation models for neural data** — EEG, fMRI, ECoG, spikes, and beyond.  
> The goal: to build an evolving, transparent, and machine-readable map of how brain-AI models are built, shared, and reused.

---

## 🧩 Why this exists

Neural data research is exploding — but tracking *which models exist*, *what data they use*, and *how they connect* is hard.  
**NeuroSource** makes that knowledge structured, searchable, and open.

Think of it as:

> 🗺️ *“Papers with Code” for neural foundation models.*

Each model is described by a lightweight YAML file with consistent metadata (architecture, modality, dataset, year, links, etc.).  
Anyone can contribute — labs, students, or readers of new papers.

## 💡 How to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repo  
2. **Add your model**
   - Create a new file under `models/<modality>/<model_name>_<year>.yaml`
   - Follow the schema in `/schema/model.schema.json`
3. **Open a Pull Request**

Each PR is automatically checked for:
- ✅ Correct field names / formatting  
- ✅ Valid URLs  
- ✅ Consistency with schema  

Once approved, it appears in the public index.

## 🌱 Roadmap


✅ MVP -------------  Launch repo + schema + seed models

🚧 Next ------------- Auto-generate Markdown index of models 

🧭 Later ------------- Integrate into NeuroSource meta-research dashboard

🌐 Future ------------- Interactive web explorer (GitHub Pages + JSON index)

## 🧩 Example Query Ideas (Future)

Once the data grows, we’ll be able to ask questions like…

> “Show all EEG foundation models released after 2023.”  
> “Which fMRI architectures reuse EEG pretraining?”  
> “How many open-weights models exist per modality?”
